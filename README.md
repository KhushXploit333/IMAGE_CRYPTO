# Image Encryption Tool

## Overview

This project is a simple image encryption tool that utilizes pixel manipulation techniques, such as swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations. It also incorporates RSA encryption to secure the image data, ensuring that your images are protected from unauthorized access.

## Features

- **Pixel Manipulation**: Swaps pixel values and applies basic mathematical operations to enhance security.
- **RSA Encryption**: Uses RSA public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt image data.
- **User -Friendly**: Simple command-line interface for easy image encryption and decryption.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thencrypt-K3/IMAGE_CRYPTO.git
   cd image_cryptography

2.Install the required libraries: Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
  ````bash
            pip install Pillow cryptography
Run the program:
   
              python RSA_RSAI.py
